## Interplanetary Consensus (IPC)
There is a very good chance you came ashore in a quest to learn more about IPC. You have come to the right place, though we recommend having a look at the [project website](https://ipc.space/) for a higher-level overview, as well as the [docs](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/interplanetary-consensus/overview/) and at the [design reference](https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/IPC-design-reference-spec/blob/main/main.pdf) for more details.
